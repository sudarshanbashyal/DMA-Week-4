# Week 4 - Coding Challenge

The coding challenge for this week was also related to Intents and Activities.
The application needed two activities. The first activity had three buttons, and clicking on any of the button would start the second activity and different 
paragraph would be displayed depending on which button was clicked.

## Displaying different texts with Intent
